#### Acknowledgement

The major package used to pull the captions themselves was the 
youtube_transcript_api package.  You can find details on it at the below link.

## Usage (Coming Soon)

#### Youtube Caption Data and Metric Pulling


#### stock_pred_model.py

The stock_pred_model.py code will take the (current) caption data that the lambda 
fuction builds that then plot that with the associated Stock data.  In this case
the data and code has been written for Nvidia Youtube Searches and Stock 
comparisons (see below image for exmple of plot, and this codes potential usefulness)
